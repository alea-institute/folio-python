## Development and Testing

To set up the project for development:

* Fork the repository
* Clone the repository to your development environment
* Ensure that you have poetry installed:
  - You can install via the [official instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/main/#installing-with-the-official-installer).
  - Or you can install via [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx): `pipx install poetry`
* Install the development dependencies: `poetry install`
* Make your changes.
* Test:
  - Run the test suite: `PYTHONPATH=. poetry run pytest tests/`
  - Test full build via docker (Ubuntu 24.04): `bash docker/build.sh`
  - Test clean install via docker (Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 24.04): `bash docker/install.sh`

## Coding Style

We generally follow the [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide for Python code, but the good news is that most style
is enforced automatically via the `pre-commit` hooks in this repository.

Simply install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and run `pre-commit install` to set up the hooks. 

If you'd like to run the formatting and linting checks manually, you can do so with the following commands:
```bash
$ pre-commit run --all-files
```
